Opinionated workflow guides and best practices - the preacher's proven patterns for Claude Code projects.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/credo:help` | Comprehensive guide for project setup and plugin workflows |

## Purpose

Credo (Latin: "I believe") provides the preacher's opinionated, battle-tested workflows for Claude Code projects. These are patterns refined through daily use - a belief system for productive development.

Instead of wandering in darkness, follow the proven path:
- Project setup (greenfield and brownfield)
- Plugin integration
- Parallel development with hydra
- Code quality automation
- And more

## Philosophy

This plugin represents the preacher's continuously refined approach. It's opinionated by design - not trying to cover every possible workflow, but providing clear guidance for what works.

## Installation

Add to your marketplace or copy to `.claude-plugin/`.
