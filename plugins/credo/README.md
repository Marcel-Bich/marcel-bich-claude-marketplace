# Credo

Opinionated workflow guides and best practices - the author's proven patterns for Claude Code projects.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/credo:help` | Comprehensive guide for project setup and plugin workflows |

## Purpose

Credo (Latin: "I believe") provides the author's opinionated, battle-tested workflows for Claude Code projects. These are patterns refined through daily use - a belief system for productive development.

Instead of figuring out the "right" way yourself, follow these proven patterns:
- Project setup (greenfield and brownfield)
- Plugin integration
- Parallel development with hydra
- Code quality automation
- And more

## Philosophy

This plugin represents one developer's continuously refined approach. It's opinionated by design - not trying to cover every possible workflow, but providing clear guidance for what works.

## Installation

Add to your marketplace or copy to `.claude-plugin/`.
